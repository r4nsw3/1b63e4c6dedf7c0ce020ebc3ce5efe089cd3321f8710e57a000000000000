   <--( Game Info )----------------------------------------------- ----- -->                    

    Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that
    holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside,
    guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating
    the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure.

    Although you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants,
    who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside
    the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them
    to disappear...

    Plan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a
    rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty
    modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the
    difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music
    and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch.

    Just like in old NES games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to
    your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything
    much more than the artefacts you've found…

    Features:
    Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming.
    Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock.
    Randomly generated castle, 216 rooms to overcome.
    Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.
